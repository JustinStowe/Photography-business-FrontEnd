# Photography App

## Description

A tool that addresses the majority of the needs of a photographer, hopefully serving as a one-stop shop for their needs.

## Getting Started

Link to webpage: <https://myphotographypage.herokuapp.com>

## The end goal

To create a tool that simplifies a photographer's life and helps them run their business efficiently.

## Features

- Portfolio Page

  - The front and center of the application is a public portfolio page, allowing anyone visiting the website to see the quality of the photographer's work.

- Contact Me

  - A header navigation bar with easy links to all of the services a photographer provides, with a prominent "contact me" button that is accessible from any page. The button offers two options: email or schedule a real-time face-to-face meeting.

- Scheduling Photo Shoot Appointments

  - Using a calendar service like calendly, clients can find a time that the photographer is available and book their own appointments, preventing the photographer from double-booking or overbooking.

- Photo Review

  - Clients can review the photos from their photo shoot by entering a project ID, and the photos will populate on the review page. Once they have reviewed the photos, they can submit their choices, which will send the photographer an email notification.

- Online Storage

  - An upsell for clients is online storage of their photographs, accessible from the same place where they got the photos done. This makes it easy for them to get additional editing done and for the photographer to keep track of their photos.

- Client List

  - The admin account has an organized list of all client accounts with email addresses and phone numbers, allowing the photographer to easily reach out to previous clients.

- Ease of Use
  - The admin account has full editing control over the portfolio, the ability to organize and find photos, and the ability to add photos to client accounts.
